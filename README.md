OFWorkshop_Box2D
================
The course provides an overview of 2D engine in OF for experienced OF users . You will learn how 2D engine is earlier to use. The ofxBox2d add-on will be featured. This add-on allows OF programmers to code generically, efficiently and at a high level. You will learn how to create box2d world,  draw basic box2d shapes, and create box2d edge. You'll then put this skill to use in a programming assignment aimed at producing an simple 2D game.
